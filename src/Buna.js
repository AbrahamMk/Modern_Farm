Legend has it that coffee was first discovered in Ethiopia by a goat herder named Kaldi, who noticed his goats becoming energized after eating coffee cherries. Since then, coffee cultivation has flourished in Ethiopia, and the country is known for producing some of the finest Arabica coffee beans in the world. Ethiopian coffee is often categorized into distinct regional varieties, such as Sidamo, Yirgacheffe, Harrar, and Limu, each offering its own flavor profiles and characteristics.
